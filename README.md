# MWA - Homework
1. You are in a technical interview for a fullstack engineer position, the question you will have to answer is explaining JS event loop, clarifying the synchronous and asynchronous parts, queues, priority, with examples. Write your answer as if it were for a real interview.
2. The follow up question you receive is how may we make an operation/function asynchronous?
